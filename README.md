# COVID-19
Playing with Country-level aggregated data on COVID-19
The data_structure_new file merges seperate csv files to create the master data set. 
The master data set is labeled according to tomorrow's date (21/04/2020). 
The covid-19.rmd file generates the report when "knit". 
The mobility report that I have includes only the final date on 29/03 and 5/04. 
  But, there is now a better .csv available by Google that ranges until the 14/04 AND has day-to-day info. 
 When I find time I will include a comprehensive list with the data sources.
