# Gathering weather data for JHU's COVID19 infection data

<br>
<br>
---<br>
update 3/27/2020: JHU has changed some of its grouping for certain regions and/or countries.<br>
I may start to manually break down some of the more significant regions in the US,<br>
Such as Seattle, NYC, etc, and elsewhere. I need to think about how I want to do this.<br>
---<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The data files are in the './csv' folder</b><br>
This is all just raw data. I have not done any analysis yet.<br>

Weather data is very generously Powered by Dark Sky: https://darksky.net/poweredby/

JHU's time_series_19-covid-Confirmed.csv was taken, and repurposed it to get weather data for the dates and locations that are listed.

<b>The following csv files are generated in the './csv' folder:<br></b>
  tMax.csv       - pulling 'temperatureHigh' from API call<br>
  tMin.csv       - pulling 'temperatureLow' from API call<br>
  humidity.csv   - pulling 'humidity' from API call, and multiplying by 100<br>
  uv.csv         - pulling 'uvIndex' from API call<br>
  cloud.csv      - pulling 'cloudCover' from API call and mulitplying by 100<br>
  precip.csv     - pulling 'precipProbability' from API call and multiplying by 100<br>
  dew.csv        - pulling 'dewPoint' from API call<br>
  pressure.csv   - pulling 'pressure" from API call<br>
  wind.csv       - pulling 'windSpeed' from API call<br>
  ozone.csv      - pulling 'ozone' from API call<br>
  sunrise.csv    - pulling 'sunriseTime' from API call<br>
  sunset.csv     - pulling 'sunsetTime' from API call<br>
  
<b>Values of -1000 are dummy values for when there was some sort of error in the JSON response.<br>
This will eventually be investigated and corrected.</b><br><br>
Please see https://darksky.net/dev/docs for meaning and units of each value. Where applicable, units are pulled in SI units.


The JSON returned hourly values and daily values. For the purposes of this project, daily values were used. The header for each column was taken and passed as a Unix time value to retrieve data for that date.<br><br><br>

Also, don't bother trying anything with my API key. It is reset with every push. If you want to try it for yourself, Dark Sky very generously offers 1,000 free API calls per day. https://darksky.net/poweredby/
